# Healthcare Statistics Analysis

This project performs **statistical analysis on healthcare data** to explore relationships between patient attributes such as **age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and recovery status**. It demonstrates how basic **statistical techniques** can be applied to healthcare datasets using Python.

---

## Project Overview
The dataset includes **50 patient records** with the following columns:
- Patient_ID  
- Age  
- Blood_Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Recovery_Status (Recovered / Not Recovered)

This project applies various **statistical tests** and **visualizations** to derive insights from the data.

---

## Techniques Used
- Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation)  
- Correlation Analysis  
- T-Test (Independent Samples)  
- Chi-Square Test  
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib  

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- SciPy
